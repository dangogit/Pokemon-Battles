# Pokemon-Battles
A project assignment in C that was given by the advanced programming course of 3rd semester.

In this exercise we created a system that allows you to perform Pokemon battles as well a pokedex which will store information
about Pokemon and existing Pokemon types.

To run the program use the command ./PokemonsBattles <numberOfTypes> <capacityInType> <configurationFile>

numberOfTypes - Is an integer that describes the number of Pokemon types with which 
We will work, and they should be read from the file (example 3)
capacityInType - Is an integer that describes the maximum amount of Pokemon
(Which can be entered into the battle system in any of the different types (e.g. 20)
configurationFile - Is a path to a configuration file of Pokemon and Pokemon types 
They must be read from the file and inserted into the system.

The menu:
1 : Print all Pokemons by types
2 : Print all Pokemons types
3 : Insert Pokemon to battles training camp
4 : Remove stronger Pokemon by type
5 : Fight
6 : Exit
